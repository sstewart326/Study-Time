### Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

### Algorithm ([[Sliding Window#Sliding Window|List Sliding Window Technique]])

We need to track two things
1. `max_profit`
2. `lowest_price`

```
# [4, 1, 5, 2, 7] max = 0, lowest = 4   profit is not negative, move right
#  ^

# [4, 1, 5, 2, 7] max = 0, lowest = 1   profit is negative, move left
#  ^  ^

# [4, 1, 5, 2, 7] max = 4, lowest = 1   profit is not negative, move right
#     ^  ^

# [4, 1, 5, 2, 7] max = 4, lowest = 1   profit is not negative, move right
#     ^     ^

# [4, 1, 5, 2, 7] max = 6, lowest = 1   we've reached the end, return max
#     ^        ^
```

1. `max_profit` starts at 0 (if we buy and sell the same day)
2. `lowest_price` is set to value at index 0
3. for each `price` iteration
	1. `max_profit = max(max_profit, price - lowest_price)`
	2. `lowest_price = min(lowest_price, price)`

### Solution

```
class Solution:  
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:  
        if len(prices) == 1:  
            return 0  
        lowest_price = prices[0]  
        max_profit = 0  
  
        # [4, 1, 5, 2, 7]  
        #     ^        ^  
        for price in prices:  
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - lowest_price)  
            lowest_price = min(lowest_price, price)  
  
        return max_profit
```
